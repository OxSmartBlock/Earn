## What is Earn ?
Earn is a decentralized banking platform that allows users to deposit approved cryptocurrency assets and earn rewards in the form of EARN reward tokens.
Users can also access loans through smart contracts by using their crypto assets as collateral. If a user's collateral falls below the minimum required threshold, other users have the opportunity to liquidate their position and earn from the system
